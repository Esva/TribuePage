    <body id="basic story"> <p>Waynes Musical Version of The War of the Worlds is a studio double album by American-born British musician, composer, and record producer Jeff Wayne, released on 9 June 1978 by CBS Records. It is a musical adaptation of the science-fiction novel The War of the Worlds by H. G. Wells in a rock opera style with a rock band, orchestra, narrator, and leitmotifs to carry the story and lyrics that express the feelings of the various characters. </p>
    
    <p>The album originated when Wayne was touring with singer-songwriter David Essex, for whom he also worked as his producer and musical director. Wayne felt the composing side of his career "had diminished" by this time, and started looking for a story "to get passionate about" and interpret musically, to which his father Jerry suggested the science-fiction novel The War of the Worlds by H. G. Wells.
      </p>
      
      <p> So from 1975 he worked alongside David Essex and approached esteemed actor Richard Burton to take on the role of the narator for main course line of the story, becoming the inner most thoughts of the main character, "The Journalist" and would retell the story as a past memory, and the inner most thoughts as the journalist ventured through the weird and luriod landscape of another world.
      </p>
      
      <p> Initially Wayne had Carlos Santana record guitar riffs and hooks to interpret the Martian's heat-ray, but his involvement ended after one day when Santana's manager spotted an issue in the contract and certain requests could not be met.The role of Parson Nathaniel was originally given to Free and Bad Company singer Paul Rodgers, and although Wayne thought he delivered "fantastic" vocals, Rodgers was reluctant to take on the speaking part and dropped out.Wayne has these early recordings on his original multitrack tapes, but has no interest in releasing them.The Who frontman Roger Daltrey was to also make an appearance </p>
        <p> The album features Ken Freeman on synthesisers, who started with a Minimoog and ARP Odyssey. Later in production, a Yamaha CS-80 was brought in which was used to re-record various overdubs, including the horns.Among the synthesisers used was the Thunderchild SZ3540, a custom made monophonic model built by JWM Electronics after Wayne sought for a fatter, bassy sound.Wayne wanted to create the Martian's "ooll-la" sound of their heat-rays with a synthesiser, but he could only create sounds that resemble "ooo" and "ahhh", not the "l".The final effect was achieved with a multitrack "voicebox guitar effect" devised and voiced by Jo Partridge, who plays guitar on the album and made the sound "as dramatic as possible."All but one of the foley sound effects heard on the record were created by Wayne's wife Geraldine. Wayne said the one that he is asked about the most is the sound of the cylinder unscrewing when the Martians emerge from their spaceship, which he achieved by turning and scraping two kitchen saucepans together that Young then amplified and captured in stereo.Most of the musicians on the album had also played on Essex's debut studio album Rock On (1973).Wayne wrote out the various parts of the score for the band, which was performed live in the studio without any click tracks, leaving the group "to groove together, and then move onto the next tune."It took one week to record almost an entire side of the album.The string section consisted of 50 players, led by violinist Patrick Halling. </P>

      <p> The album premiered at a launch party at the London Planetarium on 1 June 1978, and featured a playback accompanied by a laser show. The event was attended by over 500 people.The album was released on 9 June; four weeks later, Wayne said he was able to repay CBS its share of the album's costs due to strong sales.In September 1978, the album reached its peak position of No. 5 on the UK Albums Chart, during a 20-week stay in the top ten. It has since been in the UK top 100 albums for 240 weeks, and has sold over 2.7 million copies in the country. In 2018, it was the UK's 32nd best-selling studio album of all time.Elsewhere, it charted in 22 countries and reached number one in 11 of them including Australia, where it was top for seven weeks.In April 1979, the album exceeded platinum status in the Netherlands, New Zealand, and Australia, and gold certification in Canada, Spain, Israel, and Belgium.It has earned gold and platinum sales certifications in 17 countries.The album has sold an estimated 15 million copies worldwide.

The album spawned two singles. The first was "Forever Autumn", which went to No. 5 on the UK Singles Chart. This was followed by "The Eve of the War".

The album won two Ivor Novello Awards, including one for Wayne and Osborne for Best Instrumental or Popular Orchestral Work.In 1979, the album was named Best Recording in Science Fiction and Fantasy, in a panel of judges that included George Lucas, Stephen Spielberg, and Alfred Hitchcock. </p>
      <p> The album had a positive review in Record Mirror, with review Bev Briggs declaring it as "four sides of sheer excellence" and after reading the novel and feature film, the album is "the most easily stomachable of the lot." She praised the music, ideas, script, and voices, all of which complement each other, but thought the continuous, 95-minute structure forces the listener to digest it straight through.A positive review was published by Ben Ostrander in the science-fiction magazine The Space Gamer, who thought the album was "magnificent" and despite some differences between the record and the original novel, it "is a kind of rock/radio play with modern interpretations" and is "better than most crap on TV, and makes for a fun evening around the stereo."Music Week commented that the album is "superb" and predicted it will become "one of the biggest sellers."

In 2020, for Prog magazine writer Alex Burrows described the record as "the ultimate concept album and best-selling prog soundtrack of all time", concluding "it's still an album that certainly ticks all the boxes of the true definition of 'progressive': groundbreaking, cutting-edge and seminal." </p>

  For me, jeff Wayne's iconinc retelling of The War Of The Worlds, took my favorite book as a child and turned it into something Iconic. I wish I had the skill and the talent to make a tribute page that could truly show the jhoy and the excitement I get from listening to the core beats, or discribe the spine chilling terror I had as a young boy hearing the capsule unscrewing for the first time. 

Today it is my good too "I need to feel good" or my guilty "lets annoy the neighbours" music when I just want to crank it up to 11 on the stereo. In 1975 jeff Wayne along with his father concieved something, that would be huge and have a massive influence on someone that wasn't even born till nine years later, and wouldn't hear it for 16 years after conception, but what a Huge inpact he and this album had on not only me, but the world. </P>

<p> This is my tribute, though limited, To Mr Jeff Wayne and his rendition, in music of H.G Welles "The War of the Worlds" </p>
